# HTML5/JavaScript Game Tests and Demos #

This repository is used to store any minor HTML5/JavaScript Games, Demos and Tests I create in the hope the code may be useful
to other people planning on creating their own games in the future.

Many of the contained games are utilise sprite.js an MIT licensed JavaScript sprite animation framework maintained by Sprite.js maintained by Batiste.
Up to date versions of spirte.js can be found at https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js

##Contained Games.

### Space Game X
Fly around the outer star systems and fight off any enemy ships you encounter.    
My first attempt at creating an HTML5/JavaScript game, Space game X was hacked together using raw javascript. The code quality is very low and comments are almost none existent.   
Live Demo: [View](http://thybag.co.uk)   
Controls: Driving using WASD. Fire using the space bar.

### g1_demo (1-7)
A simple tank based birds-eye-view shooter, where you control a tank and attempt to fend off evil alien monsters.   
This game was created as part of a 2 part tutorial: [part 1](http://userbag.co.uk/development/making-html5-games-by-someone-who-knows-nothing-about-making-games/), [part 2](http://userbag.co.uk/development/making-html5-games-by-someone-who-knows-nothing-about-making-games-part-2/)    
Live Demo: [View](http://userbag.co.uk/demo/g1_demo/g_7/)    
Controls: Driving using arrows/WASD. Shoot using mouse to aim (click to fire).
